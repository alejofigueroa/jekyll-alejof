**TL;DR: I make websites and APIs**

My name is Alejandro Figueroa, but most of the people I work with just call me Alejo.

I'm a software developer with a focus on building .NET apps, but I also try to work on (or play with) different technologies, most of them related to web sites, APIs and backends. The list so far covers bits of Javascript (Node, Vue), Java, Python and Go.

You can find some of the code I've written at my [GitHub][github] profile.

This site was built using [Jekyll][jekyll] and [TailwindCSS][tailwind]. If you're curious, check the [source code](https://github.com/alexphi/jekyll-alejof).

The "notes" content is pulled by a build-time script (before Jekyll builds the site), using a custom-made, super-minimal [headless blog api][notes-api] created by me.
