# About Me

Hello, my name is Alejandro Figueroa, but most of the people I work with just call me Alejo.

I'm a software developer who focus on building .NET apps but also try to work on/play with different technologies, most of them related to web sites, APIs and backends.

You can find some of the code I've written at my [GitHub][github] profile.
