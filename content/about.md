**TL;DR: I make websites and APIs**

## About me

Hello, my name is Alejandro Figueroa, but most of the people I work with just call me Alejo.

I'm a software developer with a focus on building .NET apps, but I also try to work on (or play with) different technologies, most of them related to web sites, APIs and backends. The list so far covers bits of Javascript (Node, Vue), Java, Python and Go.

You can find some of the code I've written at my [GitHub][github] profile.

## About this site

This site was built using Jekyll and the "Big Picture" template from [Start Bootstrap][bootstrap].

The main section content is managed using a separate site and pulled by Jekyll using an API I built myself (basically, a super-minimal blog engine).

Check out the code for the [notes api][notes-api] and the [web app][notes-app].
