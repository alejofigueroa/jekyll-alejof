Hello, my name is Alejandro Figueroa, but most of the people I work with just call me Alejo.

I'm a software developer with a focus on building .NET apps, but I also try to work on (or play with) different technologies, most of them related to web sites, APIs and backends. The list so far covers bits of Javascript (Node, Vue), Java, Python and Go.

You can find some of the code I've written at my [GitHub][github] profile.

## About this site

This site was built using Jekyll and the "Big Picture" template from [Start Bootstrap][bootstrap].

The Notes content is pulled from the [alejof-notes-api][notes-api] before the Jekyll build. The Notes API is one of my side projects that serves as a minimal-ish headless blog engine.
